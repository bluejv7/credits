### Editorial
- Mary/Anna: Both of you are so talented in raising the bar for quality content and finding the different
types of topics that people enjoy learning or sharing with others! The vision you each have for good
content also translated to great ideas for tools to make content creation easier and efficient! I'm glad
I got to be a part of engineering some of your ideas and you helped me see how fun it can be to work
with departments outside of engineering!
- Jennifer/Evan/Colin/Robert/Jazmin/Sarah/Teresa/Stacie: All of you were extremely vital to the creation
of quality content for Topix and I found myself spending a lot of time enjoying your quizzes/slideshows
several times throughout the week! I'm glad I got to work closely with all of you through developing
features on the CMS and fixing bugs. Your feedback helped so much and the positivity from each of you
always made me look forward to coming into work each and every day! I learned a lot from you all and
you all made editorial one of my favorite teams to develop features for ðŸŽ‰
