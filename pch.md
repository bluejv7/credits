## PCH
### Engineers
- Alylu: You're such an amazing engineer and we've
accomplished so many things with such a small team!
I'm grateful for your encouragement, efficiency,
attention to detail, and reminding me that I should
stop working after hours if it isn't high priority.
Discussing implementation details and brainstorming
ideas with you is the only time I am happy to enter
a meeting üòÑ
- Jorge/Vageesh: Working with you both on the AppServices team helped me learn a lot about APIs and unit tests!
I appreciate you both for patiently helping me acclimate to the codebase and also providing insight on how I can
improve as an engineer.
- Prakash: Thanks for teaching me about the nova components and helping me with setting up my environment
using Docker! It was fun making components that could be used across multiple teams in PCH and I even
got to develop a couple components from scratch! üôå

### QA
- Chandra/Paul/Raj: Wow, I can't believe how much testing each of you did for all the different teams you
were a part of! I got the pleasure of working with each of you across 2 different teams, but mostly in
Offers. The communication we had was amazing and it helped that our initial interactions were inquisitive
rather than accusatory. We were able to catch bugs before it reached production, clarify user error (on
both our ends), and even when something wasn't wrong, we were able to come up with better ways to implement
certain features/changes. I'm glad you 3 were the first QA team I worked with on a regular basis! üéâ

### PMs
- Kristen/Maureen: All of you helped me out so much by relaying information to the necessary parties
whenever I was blocked on a story or by helping prioritize stories whenever I was done with my queue or
a flood of requests would come in. You all helped me be at the top of my game when implementing features
and I felt like I rarely had to be distracted by anything other than my core responsibilities. I'm really
grateful for all of that!

### Webops
- Darwin/Shasankh/Tamryn/Karteek: Thanks for helping me with all the deployments, instance maintenances,
migrations to new platforms, and adding new infrastructure! There's a lot of awesome insight you all
have imparted upon me and I got to learn a lot about how/why we do things at PCH. All of you are so
vital to keeping our apps running without a hitch üíØ

### Management/Business
- Soph: I'm glad I had the opportunity to work with you! I enjoy the way you help break down business
requirements and the feedback you give us for our implementation designs taught me a lot of new concepts
I can store in my engineering knowledge base! I appreciate how much you understand the types of struggles
engineering goes through and how much you vouch for us. I couldn't have asked for a better manager at
PCH üëç
- Smriti: I admire the drive you have towards capitalizing upon new opportunities and bringing about
innovation in growing PCH and finding new ways to rewards our users! The way you track stats and filter
out what works and what doesn't is so analytical -- I aim to learn from your example and hope people
see the same in you as well üôå
